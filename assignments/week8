Assignment 1

a)
A HEAD request only requests the header of a resource, i.e. the information about the content size, the last update, the content type etc., without actually downloading the resource. This can be used to determine whether a resource needs to be downloaded again or not while at the same time not using to many resources (disk space, processing power) on both the crawler and the crawlee.

b)
A crawler needs to take care of not crawling one host too often, because this is impolite (wasting the server's resources on a crawl task) and, in the extreme case, can cause the server to fail, because there are too many requests (denial of service). So a crawler needs to keep track about when he last crawled a server. This information is best kept in memory for one machine, instead of distributing it (which would be an unnecessary overhead for this task).

c)
It justs restarts another server. The data can be read from the transaction log, as per definition, all changes to a tablet are recorded in a transaction log.
